##**Garden.py**

This file demonstrates the use of spacy to tokenise a sentence, and then label and provide entities for the words in the sentence. This
allows for python to be able to show the meaning of individual words, and shows how spacy can group these words into categories

## **Semantic.py **

This file imports spacy and uses nlp to test the similarity of given words. This is done by creating tokens for each individual word, and 
then using the spacy module to compare for word similarity.

I also provide an example of sentence comparison using spacy

## **Watch_next.py**

This project takes a list of movie descriptions from a file and compares the sentences to a blurb for a movie within the programme. The example given here is a blurb for the "Hulk". Using spacy the programme then recommends a movie to watch based on which description is most similar.
